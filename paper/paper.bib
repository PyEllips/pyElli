  abstract={There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders---representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers---have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

Improving the practice of scholarship is a common goal of the open science, open source, and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) communities and research software is now being understood as a type of digital object to which FAIR should be applied. This emergence reflects a maturation of the research community to better understand the crucial role of FAIR research software in maximising research value. The FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group has adapted the FAIR Guiding Principles to create the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles). The contents and context of the FAIR4RS Principles are summarised here to provide the basis for discussion of their adoption. Examples of implementation by organisations are provided to share information on how to maximise the value of research outputs, and to encourage others to amplify the importance and impact of this work.},

The NeXus data format has two purposes. First, it defines a format that can serve as a container for all relevant data associated with a beamline. This is a very important use case. Second, it defines standards in the form of application definitions for the exchange of data between applications. NeXus provides structures for raw experimental data as well as for processed data.},

  abstract = {A 4{\texttimes}4-matrix technique was recently introduced by Teitler and Henvis for finding propagation and reflection by stratified anisotropic media. It is more general than the 2{\texttimes}2-matrix technique developed by Jones and by Abel\`{e}s and is applicable to problems involving media of low optical symmetry. A little later, we developed a 4{\texttimes}4 differential-matrix technique in order to solve the problem of reflection and transmission by cholesteric liquid crystals and other liquid crystals with continuously varying but planar ordering. Our technique is mathematically equivalent to that of Teitler and Henvis, but we used a somewhat different approach. We start with a 6{\texttimes}6-matrix representation of Maxwell's equations that can include Faraday rotation and optical activity. From this, we derive expressions for 16 differential-matrix elements so that a wide variety of specific problems can be attacked without repeating a large amount of tedious algebra. The 4{\texttimes}4-matrix technique is particularly well suited for solving complicated reflection and transmission problems on a computer. It also serves as an illuminating alternative way to rederive closed solutions to a number of less-complicated classical problems. Teitler and Henvis described a method of solving some of these problems, briefly in their paper. We give solutions to several such problems and add a solution to the Oseen--DeVries optical model of a cholesteric liquid crystal, to illustrate the power and simplicity of the 4{\texttimes}4-matrix technique.},

  abstract="Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) is commonly used to measure the optical constants of thin films and bulk materials. The optical constants vary with wavelength, which is referred to as dispersion. Rather than independently determine the optical constants at each wavelength, it is convenient to use an equation to describe their dispersion. A dispersion equation simplifies the description of the optical constants and improves the efficiency of data analysis. We begin this chapter by describing the optical constants, optical resonance, and the Kramers-Kronig relations. Different absorption phenomena are also briefly described. Many dispersion equations relate an optical resonance or absorption in terms of the complex dielectric function. Multiple resonance and absorption features can be summed to describe the overall dielectric function for the material. Finally, we review the common dispersion equations used for photovoltaic materials. The Cauchy and Sellmeier equations are used to describe transparent materials. The Lorentz, Harmonic, and Gaussian equations describe a resonant absorption. The Tauc-Lorentz and Cody-Lorentz were developed for amorphous semiconductors with dispersion features necessary to describe the optical functions near the bandgap energy. Additional dispersion equations are designed to describe the critical points in semiconductor band structure. We conclude this review with a description of polynomials, splines, and basis-splines, which are used to empirically match the optical functions of many materials.",

To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, we calculate the reflectivities, electric field distributions, and dispersion curves for surface phonon polaritons excited in the Otto geometry for selected model systems, where we observe several distinct phenomena ranging from critical coupling to mode splitting, and surface phonon polaritons in hyperbolic media.},

An advanced thin-film structure can consist of multiple materials with different thicknesses and numerous layers. Design and optimization of complex thin-film structures with multiple variables is a computationally heavy problem that is still under active research. To enable fast and easy experimentation with new optimization techniques, we propose the Python package Transfer Matrix Method - Fast (TMM-Fast), which enables parallelized computation of reflection and transmission of light at different angles of incidence and wavelengths through the multilayer thin film. By decreasing computational time, generating datasets for machine learning becomes feasible, and evolutionary optimization can be used effectively. Additionally, the subpackage TMM-Torch allows us to directly compute analytical gradients for local optimization by using PyTorch Autograd functionality. Finally, an OpenAI Gym environment is presented, which allows the user to train new reinforcement learning agents on the problem of finding multilayer thin-film configurations.},

Relying on a 4×4-matrix formalism, PyLlama implements not only the transfer matrix method, that is the most popular choice in existing codes, but also the scattering matrix method, which is numerically stable in all situations (e.g., thick, highly birefringent cholesteric structures at grazing incident angles). PyLlama is also designed to suit the practical needs by allowing the user to create, edit and assemble layers or multilayered domains with great ease. In this article, we present the electromagnetic theory underlying the transfer matrix and scattering matrix methods and outline the architecture and main features of PyLlama. Finally, we validate the code by comparison with available analytical solutions and demonstrate its versatility and numerical stability by modelling cholesteric media of varying complexity. A detailed documentation and tutorial are provided in a separate user manual. Applications of PyLlama range from the design of optical components to the modelling of polaritonic effects in polar crystals, to the study of structurally coloured materials in the living world.

  Program Title: PyLlama – Python Toolkit for the Electromagnetic Modelling of Multilayered Anisotropic Media CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/dzw8x5vyrv.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/VignoliniLab/PyLlama Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Python Supplementary material: User guide and tutorials at https://pyllama.readthedocs.io/ Nature of problem: Computation of the optical reflection and transmission coefficients of arbitrary multilayered linear media, composed of an arbitrary number of layers, possibly mixing isotropic and anisotropic, absorbing and non-absorbing materials, for linearly or circularly polarised light. Solution method: Implementation of both the transfer matrix method (faster) and the scattering matrix method (more robust) relying on a 4×4 matrix formalism. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Integration of a physical model to handle cholesteric structures, blueprint for the integration of user-created custom systems, hassle-free export of spectra for non-programmers even for complex and/or custom systems. External routines include: Numpy [1], Scipy [2], as well as Sympy [3] (optional).

  abstract = {We present PyMoosh, a Python-based simulation library designed to provide a comprehensive set of numerical tools allowing the computation of essentially all optical characteristics of multilayered structures, ranging from reflectance and transmittance to guided modes and photovoltaic efficiency. PyMoosh is designed not just for research purposes, but also for use cases in education. To this end, we have invested significant effort in ensuring the user-friendliness and simplicity of the interface. PyMoosh has been developed in line with the principles of open science and considering the fact that multilayered structures are increasingly being used as a testing ground for optimization and deep learning approaches. We provide in this paper the theoretical basis at the core of PyMoosh, an overview of its capabilities, as well as a comparison between the different numerical methods implemented in terms of speed and stability. We are convinced such a versatile tool will be useful for the community in many ways.},
