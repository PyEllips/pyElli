# Summary

PyElli is an open-source analysis tool for the linear optical interaction of layered materials written in Python.
It primarily targets spectroscopic ellipsometry but is adaptable to various transmission and reflection experiments.

Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) is used throughout various scientific fields to determine the optical constants of layered material stacks.
SE experiments do not yield directly usable data; numerical analysis is required to deduce actual material parameters.
This is typically done with the transfer-matrix method (TMM), which associates an interaction matrix with the optical response of each material layer.
The full optical response of a material system is then determined by matrix multiplication of the layers' matrices.

Proprietary software for such analysis is usually bundled with ellipsometers, with each manufacturer supplying their own adapted version.
While this suits laboratory workflows, it ties scientists to specific optical models and experiments available in the provided software.
This makes results hard to reproduce with other systems and data interchange cumbersome.
If the software does not support a specific kind of analysis, such as calculating anisotropic materials or simultaneous fitting of external experimental parameters, scientists need to use third-party software.

PyElli offers an open-source alternative to existing solutions while remaining as compatible as possible.
This allows scientists to adapt PyElli to their needs, either for custom experiments not covered by other software [@eberheim2022] or as a full FAIR data [@Wilkinson2016] analysis pipeline for SE measurements.
It is designed with extensibility and adaptability in mind, enabling scientists to easily develop custom analysis pipelines.
PyElli also supports recent advances in the standardization of ellipsometry data and models, addressing the need for FAIR data.

The optical models used in PyElli adhere closely to the literature [@Hilfiker2018].
New dispersions can be added as code, or a generic formula dispersion can be used, which parses a text-based formula into a fittable dispersion.

For analyzing materials, it is helpful to have a database of predefined models.
PyElli includes the popular public domain database for optical constants [refractiveindex.info](https://refractiveindex.info) [@rii], allowing users to load literature dispersions with a single line of code.

PyElli supports multiple solving algorithms with different characteristics.
Currently, two algorithms using different formulations are available: a simple but fast algorithm based on a 2x2 matrix formulation [@byrnes2020multilayer] and a more complex 4x4 formulation [@Berreman72].
While the 2x2 algorithm splits the light into two perpendicular polarized beams and solves them separately, the 4x4 matrix approach solves the complete electromagnetic field, allowing for the solution of more complex problems, such as anisotropic materials or active media.

For fast processing, PyElli's algorithms are fully vectorized for multiple wavelengths and leverage numerical algebra libraries like [NumPy](https://numpy.org) [@harris2020array] and [SciPy](https://scipy.org) [@2020SciPy-NMeth].
This allows the use of advanced fitting algorithms, such as global optimizers, within reasonable evaluation times and enables embedded in-situ monitoring of overlayer growth.
The use of Python and vectorization libraries also facilitates the adoption of artificial intelligence-based analysis of SE data.

# Statement of need

The importance of publishing data according to the FAIR principles [@Wilkinson2016] is growing.
Many research journals already require authors to add supporting data, and sponsors are starting to demand data governance from institutes and researchers.
Since reproducing data requires not only the data itself but also the software used to create it, the FAIR principles have recently been extended to apply to research software as well[@Barker2022].
We believe that producing FAIR data and using a FAIR and open analysis pipeline is especially important for SE, as the results are tightly related and dependent on the algorithms and models used for evaluation.

An open-source toolkit has many inherent benefits over proprietary software.
For SE, optical models vary between manufacturers, and translation can be difficult without clear documentation.
PyElli's open-source nature makes optical models extendable, auditable, and comprehensible.
Each version of PyElli is associated with a DOI and a Zenodo upload, allowing for reliable referencing and reproducibility of analysis results.
It supports [NXellipsometry](https://fairmat-experimental.github.io/nexus-fairmat-proposal/9636feecb79bb32b828b1a9804269573256d7696/classes/contributed_definitions/NXellipsometry.html#nxellipsometry), a recent advancement in SE data standardization.
This standard is developed by the German consortium [FAIRmat](https://www.fair-di.eu/fairmat) within the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) and is accepted by the [NeXus International Advisory Committee (NIAC)](https://www.nexusformat.org/NIAC.html), which has been maintaining beamline standards in the [NeXus format](https://www.nexusformat.org) for over 20 years [@Konnecke2015].
PyElli is also available as an [example](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/nomad-lab/nomad-remote-tools-hub/-/tree/develop/docker/ellips/example) and a cloud-based [analysis tool](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/gui/analyze/north) in the research data management software [NOMAD](https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/) [@Scheffler2022].

In summary, we believe and hope that PyElli will contribute to easier analysis, reproducibility, and FAIR data management within the ellipsometry community.

# Software with similar functionalities

Other notable Python open-source software for solving transfer-matrices is available, but tends to focus on different aspects:

- [PyGTM](https://pygtm.readthedocs.io) [@Passler17; @Passler19] provides a slower but more extensive general transfer matrix approach. It allows calculation of additional parameters, like the local strength of the electric field at any position in the multilayer stack.
- [PyLlama](https://pyllama.readthedocs.io) [@Bay2022] focuses on the simulation of liquid crystals and uses non-vectorized TMM and a scattering matrix algorithm (rigorous coupled-wave analysis, RCWA).
- [RayFlare](https://rayflare.readthedocs.io) [@Pearce2021] is a complete toolkit to simulate the physical and electrical properties of solar cells. It provides the same 2x2 algorithm[@byrnes2020multilayer] and a scattering matrix approach (S4).
- [tmm_fast](https://github.com/MLResearchAtOSRAM/tmm_fast) [@Luce22] is a fast variant of Byrnes' algorithm for artificial intelligence-based analysis of multilayer stacks.

# Example: Building a simple model

Building an optical model in PyElli is simple and straightforward.
Here, we will demonstrate by creating a standard model for SiO2 on Si.
We will use a Cauchy dispersion function for SiO2 and tabulated literature values for Si loaded from the refractiveindex.info database.

Before building the model, we need to import the necessary libraries.
PyElli is imported from the module `elli`, and we want to use our parameters wrapper `ParamsHist`, which is imported from `elli.fitting`. `ParamsHist` is a wrapper around the `Parameters` class from [lmfit](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/index.html) [@matt_newville_2023_7810964], adding history to it so you can revert your model to an earlier set of parameters.
We also import `linspace` from `numpy` for generating a wavelength axis.

```python
from numpy import linspace
import elli
from elli.fitting import ParamsHist, fit
```

First, we instantiate the parameters.
We only need `n0` and `n1` for SiO2, so we keep all other values at their default, which is zero in this case.
Additionally, we introduce the thickness of SiO2 in nanometers.
Here, you may also add additional settings for lmfit parameters.
For a list of parameter arguments, refer to lmfit's documentation or consult our verbose [basic example](https://pyelli.readthedocs.io/en/stable/auto_examples/plot_01_basic_usage.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-plot-01-basic-usage-py).

```python
params = ParamsHist()
params.add("n0", value=1.452)
params.add("n1", value=36.0)
params.add("thickness", value=20)
```

Now, the Cauchy model is created using the `Cauchy` class.
Each dispersion has its own class, and you'll find a list of different dispersions in our [documentation](https://pyelli.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dispersions.html).
It is important to note that there are two types of parameters for dispersions: **Single parameters**, which only appear once in the formula (e.g., `n0` and `n1`), and **repeated parameters** which represent one element of a sum and may be used in an arbitrary amount.
Single parameters are added to the class constructor, like `Cauchy(param1, ...)`, and repeated parameters are added via the `.add(...)` method, like `Sellmeier().add(A=param_a, B=param_b)`.
The available single and repeated parameters are listed in the documentation for each dispersion.
We are using a Cauchy model here, which only takes single parameters.
Therefore, we pass all parameters to the class constructor.
Subsequently, the `.get_mat()` function is called on the created object to automatically convert the dispersion into an isotropic material.

```python
SiO2 = elli.Cauchy(
  params["n0"],
  params["n1"],
).get_mat()
```

To request tabulated literature values for silicon, we instantiate the refractiveindex.info database and query it for the material (`Si`) and author (`Aspnes`).
It is possible to search the database first to get a list of matching entries.
See the [documentation](https://pyelli.readthedocs.io/en/stable/database.html) for details.

```python
rii_db = elli.db.RII()
Si = rii_db.get_mat("Si", "Aspnes")
```

With all materials instantiated, we can build the layered structure.
The `Structure` class takes three arguments:

- The incident half-space, which is typically air.
- The layer stack as an array of `Layer` objects. The `Layer` object is created by adding the material and the layer thickness.
- The lower half-space, which represents the substrate.

The incident and lower half-space are modeled as infinite to terminate the calculation.
Therfore backside scattering of the substrate cannot be introduced into the calculation.

```python
structure = elli.Structure(
    elli.AIR,
    [elli.Layer(SiO2, params["thickness"])],
    Si,
)
```

Finally, we trigger a calculation by calling `evaluation(...)` on the structure.
We use a `wavelengths` array from $210\;nm$ to $800\;nm$ for the calculation range and an angle of incidence of $70$ degree (second parameter of evaluate).

```python
wavelengths = np.linspace(210, 800, 100)
result = structure.evaluate(wavelengths, 70)
```

The calculation is stored in the `result` variable, which is a [`Result` object](https://pyelli.readthedocs.io/en/stable/result.html).
This object can hold all input parameters and the calculation results. You can call methods like `psi`, `delta`, `R`, etc., to get your desired output.
We can also use the `@fit` decorator in `elli.fitting` to automatically show a widget-based fitting GUI for Jupyter notebooks.
Figure \autoref{fig:fit_dec_example} shows the output when used with this example model and some experimental data.
