## Version 0.11.0

- Adds reading functionality for [NeXus files](https://fairmat-experimental.github.io/nexus-fairmat-proposal/50433d9039b3f33299bab338998acb5335cd8951/classes/contributed_definitions/NXellipsometry.html#nxellipsometry).

- Dispersions are initialized with two distinguished set of parameters for parameters which are set once and parameters which may be set multiple times (for oscillators etc). They can be added by invoking the `add` command on the respective class.
- There is a new factory class `DispersionFactory` to get a dispersion from it's string name, i.e. `DispersionFactory.get_dispersion(...)`
